##Markdown and Github

###Key ideas

**Markdown** is a markup language used extensively in documentation tasks as a way to add lightweight formatting to plain text files. There are several flavors of markdown in common use, most notably on Wikipedia and Github. We will use markdown often to make nice looking documents so it's a good place to start!

**Github** is a social network where programmers can share code and collaborate on software projects.  It is heavily integrated with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).  While intended for use in software development, git is also useful for more general collaborative projects.  Git can be used either from the command line or via a [desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/).
